Description: An implementation of a computationally efficient method to fit large-scale interaction models based on the relucatant interaction selection principle. The method and its properties are described in greater depth in Yu, G., Bien, J., and Tibshirani, R.J. (2019) "Relucatant interaction modeling", which is available at <http://arxiv.org/abs/1907.08414>.
